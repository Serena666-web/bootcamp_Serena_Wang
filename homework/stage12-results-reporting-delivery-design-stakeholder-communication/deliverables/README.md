Audience & Rationale

Primary audience: Product Managers and Ops/Business leads who need to make a configuration choice quickly.
Rationale: They’re time-constrained and decision-oriented. They need a clear recommendation, 2–3 clean charts, and a brief explanation of assumptions/risks and how sensitive results are to those assumptions.

Why this format fits their needs

Concise & scannable: A short written report (Markdown) keeps the focus on the headline metrics and takeaways without slide overhead.

Reproducible: The figures are generated from code (not manual edits), so results are consistent across reruns.
