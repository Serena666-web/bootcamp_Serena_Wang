For my small Flask service that predicts the next return, the biggest deployment risks are: schema/feature changes, bad data (nulls or wrong types), distribution shift, system slowdowns or errors, and business under-performance. I’ll monitor four layers with simple, actionable thresholds. 
Data: the schema must match training; nulls on key features stay below 2%; the latest batch should arrive within 30 minutes; 
For model, I will try to achieve: a 14-day rolling MAE should be no more than 15% worse than baseline; direction accuracy should also be controlled at a moderate level; “out-of-range” predictions stay under 0.5%. 

Business: Send each alert to a named owner with a clear first action. If the schema changes, page the model owner to roll back to the last known-good bundle and re-validate features. If nulls spike or data is late, ping data on-call to pause downstream writes, backfill, and run QA checks. If PSI breaches the threshold, email the model owner and analyst to reduce risk and schedule a review. If latency rises or 5xx errors appear, page platform on-call to scale the service, inspect logs/DB, and roll back if needed. If performance slips, kick off a weekly review. Plan to retrain weekly—or sooner if PSI ≥ 0.20 for three days, the 2-week MAE exceeds baseline by more than 15%, or newly labeled data grows beyond 10% of the original training size. The model owner maintains features, dashboards, and retraining; platform on-call co-approves rollbacks; Analyst/Product reviews KPIs; log issues in GitHub with an “incident” label and link runbooks under /handoff/.
