# Project Title
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)
## Problem Statement
Sometimes it could be hard to make investment decisions regarding stocks. More specifically,when to buy in and when to sell it out? This project aims to take NVIDIA (NVDA) stock as an example to show how to use CS to help keep track of weekly fluctuation of stocks to make more informed decision. By consistently tracking and analyzing weekly stock prices, I can identify patterns, monitor volatility, and take a more disciplined, data-driven approach to investing in NVIDIA.
## Stakeholder & User
The primary stakeholder and end user is myself, as an individual retail investor. I am the one who decides how to allocate capital, and I will directly use the outputs of this project to inform my buy, hold, or sell decisions. The analysis will be updated weekly to align with my decision-making timeline.

## Useful Answer & Decision
The useful answer will be both descriptive (summarizing weekly returns, volatility, and trends) and predictive (basic signals or indicators to guide investment decisions). The main answer will include summary metrics, clear visualizations of price trends, and indicators to support weekly decision-making.

## Assumptions & Constraints
-Weekly NVIDIA stock price data is available from APIs or financial databases.

-Analysis can be performed with Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Known Unknowns / Risks
-Predictive indicators may have low reliability due to market volatility.

-Sudden external events (e.g., earnings, news, regulations) can disrupt trends.
